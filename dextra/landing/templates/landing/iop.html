	<h2 class="header-text-1">An Internet of People</h2>
	<p>This is not to tell you the points of the idea and the platform that we have set out to build today.
This is to tell you how the idea and the platform would point to how the world gets built tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Internet connects us in a way that it seems indispensable now. It is descending in the hierarchy of needs, in the sense that it is becoming one of our basic needs: To connect.</p>
<p>The internet began not as data interconnection. But as signals. Over time, we developed these signals to be able to transmit more complex information: text and media. And over time we developed the complexity of the network to be able to reach everyone through hypertext and hypermedia.</p>
<p>Soon we had a layer of data hovering in the air. Any kind of data, just there for you to tap from. And contribute to.</p>
<p>The Internet sure was a wonderful creation of the 90s. And with the new millennium, it is evolving into an Internet of Things. </p>
<p>IoT is something which takes this layer of data and information to another level. It transcends into our physical world. It gives us the power to connect things, physical entities around us, into a web. It connects them to our thoughts, it makes them conscious. It gives them life.</p>
<p>As the future is unfolding, the means of communication are developing in a way that physical proximity would no longer be required for any task (except the show of intense love, of course). We are making sure that as these communication barriers fade away, we enable one human to make the most of this exposure to the other seven billion humans.</p>
<p>Here at Dextra, what we are aiming at is not just creative talent, but to put every job in the air. A network that you can contribute to. But also something you can tap from. How without hiring people, you can get anything done. Without hanging ID cards around people's necks, we get work done from the world. It is a repository of all skills. It is everything you need - to do absolutely anything. </p>
<p>Why we start with the arts is because the barriers in art are transparent already. We have seen cultures entwine over the past century and people already know that cross platform collaboration is beautiful. </p>
<p>While we will expedite this cultural revolution, what we aim for is cross platform collaboration which is not limited to art. We are talking about collaboration between scientists and engineers not limited to papers and journals. Collaboration between doctors and patients not limited to office appointments (or even dedicated video conferencing platforms like Practo). Collaboration between restaurants and customers, between retailers and buyers, between cab drivers and commuters.</p>
<p>Imagine anything you need to do, absolutely anything, there is one platform. Google is to 'know' as Dextra would be for 'do'. You want to take a cab, you search for 'Available' 'Cab Drivers' 'Nearby'. You want an appointment with a dentist, you search for 'Available' 'Dentists' 'Anywhere in the world' (considering technology in the future enables a dentist to examine remotely). This happens because dexes would no longer be limited to talent and creativity, but absolutely anything that you can do. It is up to the search algorithm to give the most relevant results. And dexes are not just for individuals, but organizations too. You want to watch a movie, search for 'Available' 'Movie Theatres' 'Martian' 'Today' 'Nearby'. You want to make a movie, ... that we know already! And not just B2C, but also B2B and C2C. A theoretical scientist needs to test his theory through experiment, searches for experimental scientists or engineers. A programmer is having problem with some code, he searches for people who have worked on the technology. A student preparing for entrance exams needs help from a college student who says he's available for solving doubts at a small fee. All of it is based on the simple concept of all people (and organizations) telling whatever they can do, and people being able to find them to do whatever they want to be done.</p>
<p>Of course, this dream is turning into a dragon which is becoming untamable, and that is precisely why we've cut its wings to be limited to art, which people would not raise their eyebrows above their heads for. But know the potential, and feel its fire so that we know that we have a long way to go. <i>Today is just the beginning of tomorrow.</i></p>
